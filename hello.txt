git is a popular version control system and GitHub is a web-based platform for code hosting 
version control using Git , and collaboration on software development projects 

Git Ignore :

We can tell git which files and directories to ignore in a given repo using .gitignore file 
This is useful for the files that you know you never want to commit .
This includes : 
Secret keys , API keys , credentials 
operating system files 
log files 
dependencies and pakages
