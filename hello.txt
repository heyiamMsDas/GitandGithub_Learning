hey there i am learing git and github now .. I don't know what i'm typing ... ha ha 

git is a popular version control system and GitHub is a web-based platform for code hosting 
version control using Git , and collaboration on software development projects 

Git Ignore :

We can tell git which files and directories to ignore in a given repo using .gitignore file 
This is useful for the files that you know you never want to commit .
This includes : 
Secret keys , API keys , credentials 
operating system files 
log files 
dependencies and pakages 
// 

Branching in Git : 
Commands are given below :

1.git branch : Lists all your local branches . 
The currently active branch is marked with an asterisk(*).

2.git branch <branch_name> : creates a new branch . Git will prevent you from deleting 
a branch that hasn't been fully merged .

3.git branch -d <branch_name> : Deletes a branch , even if it hasn't been fully merged.
before delete you should switch another branch because you cannot delete the branch 
if you are in the same branch .  

4. git checkout <branch_name> : switches your working directories to the specified 
branch. Your files will change to reflect the state of that branch .

5.git checkout -b <new_branch_name> : creates a new branch and immediately switches to it . This is 
a handy shortcut.
