Here’s a step-by-step guide to create a repository, 
link it to GitHub, and control it through VS Code:


1. Open project folder in vs code . go to the terminal and initialise git with 

git init 


2. create a new repository in the github and  link it with vs code by typing in the vs code terminal 
the following :

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

3.add and commit:

git add .

git commit -m "Hello this has been commited" 

4.

git branch -M main 
git push -u origin main

If it’s already initialized, it may ask to pull first or force push.




and ready to code and collaborate and track your code history

// // //  The internet is required to push or send a pull request ...

// // // But we can add and commit things in offine
